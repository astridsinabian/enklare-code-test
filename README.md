# Enklare Code Test

This app can fetch jokes from [Jokeapi](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/) and the features I've applied is to only show 3 words in list view, show more button to view full joke in a modal, a legend to display what category the joke is and fetch new jokes. I've also put some effort in simple styling. My goal with this test was to make it as simple as possible with a secure mindset.

## Run app

`npm run dev`
